Javascript application development skeleton based on Broccoli assets builder for Backbone.js projects.

Before run install node modules.

```bash
$ npm install
```
To start application development:
```bash
$ npm run serve
```
To build application for production in *dist/* directory:
```bash
$ npm run build-prod
```

To run application tests:
```bash
$ npm run serve-test
```

In development mode the live reload is available, but after server start the page must be reloaded manually to get livereload.js working.  
Any changes in html and css files are immediately reflected in the browser.
